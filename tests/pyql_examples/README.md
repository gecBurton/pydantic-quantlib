All of the tests here have been shamelessly adapted from
[PyQL](https://github.com/enthought/pyql)

Note that this is licenced separately as per PyQL licence.

Please also note the many areas where PyQL is better that this project.

All credit to PyQL for anything that is good. All errors are mine alone.
